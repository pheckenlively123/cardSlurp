# cardSlurp

This small utility aims to copy photos off of flash media as quickly and as
safely as possible.  `cardslurp` recurses the mount points supplied via the
command line.  It transfers all files it finds to the target directory.  When
each file has been written to the target directory, `cardslurp` verifies that
the file is byte for byte the same as what was on the card.  If there are name
conflicts, `cardslurp` will automatically adjust the name of the file in the
target location to avoid overwriting files that are already there.

PRO TIP: If you shoot with multiple cameras, like the author of this tool,
adjust the names of the files generated by each camera, so they can never
conflict.  Most cameras support this feature, and Canon EOS cameras definitely
do.  For example, one of my cameras generates files named `PAH_####.CR2` and the
other generates files named `PBH_####.CR2`.

`cardslurp` uses the `flags` package, so it understands the `-h` option.

```
$ ./cardslurp -h
Usage of ./cardslurp:
  -debugmode
        Print extra debug information.
  -mountlist string
        Comma delimited list of card mount points.
  -targetdir string
        Target directory for the copied files.
  -transbuff int
        Transfer buffer size. (default 8192)
```

Here is a usage example from Linux.

```
./cardSlurp -mountlist /media/someuser/EOS_DIGITAL,/media/someuser/EOS_DIGITAL1 -targetdir /somewhere
```

Here is a usage example from Windows.

```
.\cardslurp -mountlist I:,F: -targetdir c:\somewhere
```

Usage on Mac should be similar to usage on Linux.

# Installation

```
cd cmd/cardslurp
make TARGET
make install
```

In the commands above, replace TARGET with one of the options below, based on
the architecture of the computer where you wish to run cardslurp.

```
mac_m1
mac_intel
linux_intel
win_intel
```

By default, Windows does not have `make`, so you might have to make the
win_intel target on Linux or Mac.
